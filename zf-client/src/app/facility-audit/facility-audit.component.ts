// Navigate tank by tank through a facility
// Allow the user, on a phone, looking at a particular physical tank, to correct
// the system's view of what stocks are in the tank (swimmers).

// Scenario 1: user looks at tank T17 which is clearly labeled with
// stock S1564.02.  But the app thinks the tank is empty.
// Allow the user to add S1564.02 to the tank along with a fish count.

// Scenario 2: user looks at a clearly empty tank T18, but the app thinks
// it contains stock S1564.02.
// Allow the user to remove stock S1564.02 from the tank.

// Scenario 3: user looks at tanks T18 which is clearly labeled with
// stock S1442 and has about 9 fish in it.  The app agrees that S1442 is
// in the tank but there are 23 fish present.
// Allow the user to correct the count.

// All of this has to come with support for multiple stocks in a single
// tank - as this does in fact happen on occasion.

// Somehow we have to deal with "virtual" tanks like "Nursery" where there
// can be many stocks and the audit is not rational for those tanks.

// Guiding philosophy - this has to be super efficient in terms of screen
// touches because there can be thousands of tanks in a facility,
// so it has to be super easy to:
// - achieve the three main functions listed above
// - navigate to the next tank (or the previous)
// - jump to any tank in the facility and get going from there
// - pick up where you last left off
// - stop the audit at any time and place
