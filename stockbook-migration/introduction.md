# Stockbook Migration

## Introduction

This is the hardest part of setting up a system.
You will probably be working with an existing facility with an existing stock book
which may have been kept on paper, in Excel, in Filemaker Pro or in some other system
and you have to tease all the information out of it and give your users a beautiful
running system.

Terminology: when you see the work marker, we are using it to mean both
transgene and mutation. 

Whene we talk about an allele for a marker, we are talking about the
origin-specific designation such as fh273 for mutation 273 from the
Fed Hutchinson Cancer Research Institute.  
Or au101Tg for transgene 101 from the University of Texas at Austin.

Note that, although ZFIN likes to suffix transgene alleles with Tg,
this is not done everywhere so au101 is an accepted allele name for
au101Tg.

Here are some approaches.

Start by making a workbook and putting all the data you received in it.
Label the sheets as "raw" and never touch them again.  Make copies.

## Identiy transgenes and mutations

Ideally every stock will have a list of alleles in some nice clean format:

All the stocks will have some
