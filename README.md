# Zebrafish Facility Manager

## Description

A software package for maintaining information about a zebrafish facility used
in genetics labs.

It has two parts. The zf_client part runs in any web browser and presents a user
interface for managing the stocks in a facility. The zf_client uses Angular.

The zf_server part runs on a computer with a database and is responsible for
storing the data for a particular facility. The zf_server is a Node.js
application written using the NestJS framework.

The two communicate via an API.

## Main Features

The main purpose of the software is to track zebrafish stocks including

- their lineage
- their genetic markers (mutations and transgenes)
- the lineage of their markers
- which tank(s) the stock occupies
- various notes and data associated with the stock (age, researchers, research
  notes...)
- simple and seamless creation of new stocks from crosses
- it provides excellent search, navigation and editing capabilities to allow
  users to focus on their work.

An ancillary aspect of the system is that it tracks the genetic markers used in
a facility so that absolute consistency is maintained throughout the system.

It also provides reports to support things like auditing a zebrafish facility.

## Deployment Documentation

The deployment documentation is written in markdown. You can use it as is in
your IDE. Alternately you use [MkDocs](https://mkdocs.org) to build a static doc
site complete with nice navigation.

MkDocs is written in Python, so you will need to install Python3 (and pip)
inorder to build the documentation. The installation process is
documented [here](https://mkdocs.org/#installation);

I also use the mkdocs-material theme, so you will have to install that too.
See [here](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/#with-pip)

Once that's done, you build the documentation website:

```shell
# navigate to the root of the repository
cd zf-usage-docs
mkdocs build
```

This generates (or overwrites) the /site sub-directory in zf-deployment-docs.
The /site directory is straight HTML, so I won't go into detail on how to deploy
it.

## Deploying the system

There are a lot of moving parts to this system, so the deployment itself is
quite a lot of work. Follow
the [InitialDeplyoment Guide](zf-deployment-docs/docs/InitialDeployment.md) to
learn how to deploy the system.

A single deployment can be used to manage several zebrafish facilities.

## Per Facility Configuration

Once your system is deployed, you need to configure it for each facility you
want to manage. Follow
the [Facility ConfigurationGuide](zf-deployment-docs/docs/PerFacility.md) to
learn how to configure the system for each facility.
