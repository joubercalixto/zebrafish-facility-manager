# User Documentation

Much of the Zebrafish Facility Manager system can be used with little or no training.

However there are some general practices which, if followed, make the system more effective in the long run.

This documentation serves as a reference to those "Best Practices" for users of the system.
These practices are not mandatory nor does the system enforce them.
