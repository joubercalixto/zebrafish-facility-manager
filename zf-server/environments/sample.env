# You need a configuration file like this for every facility managed by the system.

# Start by deciding on some concise identifier for the facility. For example "ubc".
# create a copy of this sample.env file and call it ubc.env

# Before running the server you must set an environment variable called FACILITY
# that tells the server which .env file to load.  In a bash shell that would be
#export FACILITY=ubc

# Fill in the rest of the variables below with the values specific to the facility.

# set to production or test
NODE_ENV=production

# facility specific stuff
FACILITY_ORG_NAME='University Of British Columbia'
FACILITY_ORG_SHORT_NAME='UBC'
# the very short identifier used to prefix novel mutations and transgenes in this facility
# While it makes sense to do name it the same as the FACILITY env variable, it is not required.
FACILITY_ORG_PREFIX='ubc'

# the port that the server is meant to run on. This has to be different for every facility.
PORT=3003

# configuration for the mysql database connection.
# The following are just examples and not intended to be used
DB_NAME=zf_ubc
DB_USER=zf_ubc
DB_PASSWORD=zf_ubc_really_good_password_honestly_really_good

# For validating JWTs with Auth0.
# You have to follow the Auth0 setup instructions to get these values.
AUTH0_DOMAIN='auth_0_domain'
AUTH0_AUDIENCE='auth_0_audience'

# for having a look-see at all the queries typeorm is generating
TYPEORM_LOG_QUERIES=false
# leave this alone, really
